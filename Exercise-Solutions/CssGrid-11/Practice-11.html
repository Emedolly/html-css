inline-block alignment issue and also  the div we have to use side by side because all the spaces will considered as one so by using grid we can elemente this 
2*3 grid = 2 rows 3 columns 
display : grid ;
grid-template-columns : 100px 100px (these are no of columns)
alignment much better here
1fr - freespace (it will take the rest of the space and when risizing it wont create any issue)
