one element on top of that other element will use position

Position - fixed (placed in the browser window)
absolute - placed on the page
z-index - defines which elements should show first

if an element is inside(absolute elemt) as in side fixed then it will take the properties of fixed only which will be stick to the window 
where as the same if we do with relative and then it will be good to move 
(relative - inside sbsolute)
ex: video thumbnail-relative 
video timing - absolute
